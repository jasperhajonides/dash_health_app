Keep in mind that this is a very rough estimate and actual values may vary. The amino acid content in particular is difficult to estimate and would depend on the specific composition of the protein sources in the dish. The glycemic index is an estimation as well since it can vary based on the specific ingredients and how they are prepared. Nutritional contents such as histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine are typically not calculated for general nutritional profiles unless a detailed nutritional analysis is conducted on the dish.","A hearty dish of vegetarian chili made with sweet potatoes, rice, black beans, corn, and a savory sauce.",50.0,10.0,4.1

Additionally, without knowing the exact ingredients and preparation method, it is challenging to accurately estimate the nutritional values.

Nonetheless, I can guide you on how you might estimate the nutritional content based on typical values for similar dishes. First, you would need to determine the approximate weight of each component in the dish (roti, green beans with potatoes, and vegetarian chicken). Then, using nutritional databases such as the USDA FoodData Central, you could look up each ingredient and calculate the nutritional values based on the estimated serving sizes.

If you're interested in general information about the nutritional content of these types of foods, I can give you a very rough estimate for a typical serving (these values can vary significantly based on specific recipes and portion sizes):
