Please note that the actual amino acid composition can vary widely based on the food source. The amino acid values provided are rough estimates:

{
  ""essential amino acids"": {
    ""histidine"": 700, 
    ""isoleucine"": 1095,
    ""leucine"": 1910, 
    ""lysine"": 1595, 
    ""methionine"": 495, 
    ""phenylalanine"": 1035,
    ""threonine"": 895,

These values are based on a typical distribution of amino acids in general protein sources and do not take into account the specific makeup of the food in the image, which looks like it could be a slice of quiche with a side of sweet potato fries and some shredded carrot salad. The actual amino acid profile for this meal would depend heavily on the ingredients used (e.g., the"
