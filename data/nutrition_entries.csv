These values are based on a typical distribution of amino acids in general protein sources and do not take into account the specific makeup of the food in the image, which looks like it could be a slice of quiche with a side of sweet potato fries and some shredded carrot salad.

If you would like to know the approximate amount of each amino acid in a food item containing 24g of protein, we can estimate the value based on a typical protein profile. However, it's important to note that the amino acid profile will vary significantly depending on the specific food source of the protein. Here's a general estimation assuming it's a well-balanced protein source:

However, I can give you a general estimation assuming it is a common source of protein like meat, dairy, or legumes.

Keep in mind that these values can vary significantly depending on the actual protein source. The numbers below are rough estimates based on an average profile of essential and non-essential amino acids commonly found in a variety of protein sources.
