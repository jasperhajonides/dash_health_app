The serving size estimate is for one taco, assuming each taco has a similar amount of ingredients. Nutrition information can widely vary depending on the recipe and preparation methods. The amino acid content, glycemic index, and other micronutrient values are particularly challenging to estimate exactly without specific analysis and are therefore approximations. The glycemic index value assumes a traditional corn tortilla without additional sweeteners or high-GI ingredients. Please use these values as a general guide rather than definitive nutritional information.","Three traditional tacos with grilled beef, diced onions, chopped cilantro, each served on a corn tortilla, accompanied by a lime wedge and a radish on the side.",30.0,8.0,4.9,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.3,2.0,3.0,4.01,
